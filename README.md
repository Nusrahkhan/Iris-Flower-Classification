# Iris-Flower-Classification

This project implements a classification model to categorize iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Using the classic Iris dataset, I trained a machine learning model to predict the species based on sepal and petal measurements.

# Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning project that uses supervised learning techniques to classify iris flowers based on physical characteristics. This problem is one of the most well-known in machine learning and provides a simple but robust example for classification models.
